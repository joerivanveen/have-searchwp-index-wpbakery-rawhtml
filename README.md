# SearchWP -> WPBakery

Do you use SearchWP to have better search results in your WordPress website and WPBakery to edit your content?

You may discover that **SearchWP does not index the RAW html blocks from WPBakery** (vc_raw_html).

Just install (upload) this plugin in your plugins folder and activate it.

Works with SearchWP 4.0 and higher only.
